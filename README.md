GameMemo
========

App description
----------------------------
An Android app to track, memorize and share board or card games.

It currently supports games like Tichu, Doppelkopf and minigolf.

Features
----------------------------
Games define their own UI, but can access a common shared player database. Statistics are supported via a separate statistics package. Played games can be shared via bluetooth with nearby friends (integrated UI) or via general Android share utility. So you can keep your highscores up to date.

Installation notes
----------------------------
An .apk file is available, so you can directly try the current build on your android device of choice.
[.apk file]

If you want to help develop or simply want to look at the code, the repository hosts an Eclipse project. Simply import it and make sure you have the Android plugins installed and you should be good to go. If you want to help support a certain game, check the code that's already there and adapt it to your needs. Send me a pull request when you're done ;)
