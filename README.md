# GameMemo
Android app to track, memorize and share board or card games

My first bigger software project (which explains lots of mess) which helped me learn a lot about Java, Android and GitHub.
Originated from the need of me and my friends to keep track of scores of the card game **Tichu** on pieces of paper, unable to resume unfinished games of ours and unable to get good statistics.

This app is published, functional and without ads, but was never promoted: 
**Check out [GooglePlay](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dan.dit.gameMemo) for description of features and images.**

Lately included Binokel for my girlfriend's friends when I noticed you are able to add new games, but it involves quite some insight into the project.
