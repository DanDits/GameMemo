Introduction:
This is a work in progress project started in fall 2012. It all started by the need of having a piece of paper and a pencil in various places to play the card game Tichu and my desire to learn something about android programming. Since this is my first project and the learning curve was somehow steep, some classes that previously were just built to work and not be beautiful, will be reworked and improved over time.

Aims:
The plan is to make the app be able to keep score and track of various card, board or sport games giving the ability to share games and built statistics. I have seen some score keeping apps currently available for android and know that this already exists in one form or another. I plan to offer one app that can deal with many different situations, different team setups, round based team games like Tichu, games like minigolf or even chess. So most classes must offer a general interface to view all games, share, show statistics or setup a game. For specific games you can then implement an adapter and a game view that simplifies the input for this game.

Installation:
This is an eclipse project and can be easily installed by importing it to an eclipse workspace. You need to have the targeted android sdk-version installed. For other development environments you will probably need to remove some eclipse specific directories (sorry for that, I was new to GIT).

What you can do:
As soon as the basic framework is up you can implement the overview adapter and detail view of a specific game or of course improve any of the existing code.
